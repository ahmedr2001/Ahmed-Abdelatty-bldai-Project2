These notions are wonderfully explored in this course, especially in the Tactile Line and Atmospherics classes. My favorite is the drawing sequence for a rock. I think they are difficult to draw, and Mr. Eviston demonstrates some strategies that have been helpful and problem-solving for it.

Fortunately the Udemy interface allows me to play it at 2x speed to get through it quicker without missing anything interesting. Your brain gets used to the speed pretty quickly and before you know it you don't even notice that it is faster than normal. Similarly, since all MS Office products share the ribbon interface and Office Backstage, most of that is similar to what I saw in the MS Project course. If you are taking several MS Office courses you will see some redundancy but you can speed past it or use it as review. \nAs I got into the advanced portion of the course I found that it went beyond what I typically need to use Excel for. While I need to be able to use some other products such as MS Project or MS OneNote at an advanced level, I’m probably fine with using Excel at an intermediate level. I’m not a statistician or a finance and accounting guy and some of the material was interesting but not something I will typically use in my daily job.

As has been true in the other courses I have taken with him, his style of presentation is slow and methodical. He demonstrates each tool and technique while clearly describing each as he works. He gives many opportunities to practice each, but encourages students to do more and more of the practice sets to deeply embed these basic skills into place. Section 2, Day 3: Beyond the Box was my favorite and most challenging. I thought I understood how boxes in space respond to perspective, but when I started drawing them myself, I often got confused or just lost in the process. A quick rewind of the lesson helped me find my confusion, correct my image, and then move to another. It took me six or seven times of drawing many boxes before I finally understood and could see how to use the techniques to create boxes in space and in perspective. The ending project is fun to do because he has found a way to put all of the skills in this and his earlier courses to work to produce a satisfying final drawing. There are more courses in this series, and I cannot wait to study more with him!  Dave in California",

That is very frustrating. Its happened multiple times, most notably with vlookup. We were just expected to have previous knowledge of this function I guess? But there were other ones too. \n\nIt's not a bad course though, I'm learning a lot and I still recommend it\n\nEdit: So I just finished the course.\nSome more complaints I had were it would be nice to have more exercises later in the course. Especially the last Section, that's the best way to solidify the learnings he taught us. \nI also would have liked to know how to create or update charts with VBA, but I think if I searched for some online tutorials I probably wouldn't be too lost figuring it out.\nAlso I did almost the entire course with captions (no audio), they could be a bit better.. a lot of it didn't make any sense, a lot of times I was just guessing what he was saying.\nOverall I feel like it was well worth the money for this course, I feel like I could actually go into work and design some interesting things. \nGlad I purchased the course, thanks for teaching me.

That is very frustrating. Its happened multiple times, most notably with vlookup. We were just expected to have previous knowledge of this function I guess? But there were other ones too. </p>\n\n<p>It's not a bad course though, I'm learning a lot and I still recommend it</p>\n\n<p>Edit: So I just finished the course.<br>Some more complaints I had were it would be nice to have more exercises later in the course. Especially the last Section, that's the best way to solidify the learnings he taught us. <br>I also would have liked to know how to create or update charts with VBA, but I think if I searched for some online tutorials I probably wouldn't be too lost figuring it out.<br>Also I did almost the entire course with captions (no audio), they could be a bit better.. a lot of it didn't make any sense, a lot of times I was just guessing what he was saying.<br>Overall I feel like it was well worth the money for this course, I feel like I could actually go into work and design some interesting things. <br>Glad I purchased the course, thanks for teaching me.

The final project uses a lot of packages and outside resources which means that 5 years from now you would probably have to update a lot of the code for the project to make it continue to work. Packages and outside resources have updates and newer versions constantly. This means you have to stay up to date with them and so does your code!</p>",

By the time I was done with my second semester I actually felt pretty competent in R. Not to the point where I can just look at a problem and instantly know how to code it (like some R wizards can do), but to the point where I actually feel comfortable explaining how to do lots of things in R to other people who are just starting and being able to figure out moderately complex problems on my own or with minimal google searching for function syntax.  \n\nThis course was an absolutely critical component of my learning experience. It made me realize that you don't need to memorize everything about R, you just need to understand what tools R gives you and then frame your problem in those terms. Kirill is an excellent teacher and he really gets to the meat of each skill and technique he is trying to show you in each lesson. He doesn't gloss over things, he explains them in basic terms and builds from there. He seems to have a good intuition for what you're thinking as he explains things, too. There were many times where I would be following his lesson and ask myself a question only to have him bring it up a moment later and explain it fully. \n\nIf you do buy his course, I would advise you to do the lessons in chunks and make sure you really get what was taught before moving on to the next ones. Most importantly, go back and reference lessons when needed. I did this countless times and it really helped to reinforce my learning. If I was stuck on a particular part of a problem in real life I would think \"wait, I saw something like this in the tutorials\" and then I would go back and watch that lesson. Every time I did this it helped me to better understand the reasoning behind it instead of just quickly googling an answer that I only half understand.\n\nSo, in summary, this course helped me out tremendously as both a straight up tutorial with applicable content and also as a valuable reference that I could always go back to when needed to ensure I understood why certain functions or methods worked the way they do. I highly recommend this course!",

Since nowadays I dedicate myself more to programming than to web layout, practical exercises such as replicating websites go very well to keep my knowledge of css, boostrap, etc. up to date.

Luckily I learned programming and web design by other means, because of this course I can only save the practice as an exercise to review my knowledge, replicate it for the pleasure of practicing. Since nowadays I dedicate myself more to programming than to web layout, practical exercises such as replicating websites go very well to keep my knowledge of css, boostrap, etc. up to date. But if you start from scratch, with this course you will be lost if you think that only by watching it you can replicate a website without any help. There are much better courses than this.</p>",

You do need to have HTML, CSS and JS knowledge unless you want to use this course as a cookbook. In that case, it will serve you well. Although the instructor explains HTML and CSS in greater detail than JS, he still uses parts that weren't covered or, at least, talked about in previous lessons. I regard this course as practice after you've learned the web trinity and you want to practice it on a webpage. \n\nIf you've never touched JavaScript, the code you type will do its thing but you won't know why it is used or how it actually works. Directing students to job sites like Upwork or Freelancer with only the knowledge gathered during this course is a great mistake unless you have decided to do some background reading about HTML, CSS and JS on MDN, W3Schools or another reference site, and made a couple of websites yourself. The most useful part for me in this course was figuring out how to use Bootstrap framework.",

You do need to have HTML, CSS and JS knowledge unless you want to use this course as a cookbook. In that case, it will serve you well. Although the instructor explains HTML and CSS in greater detail than JS, he still uses parts that weren't covered or, at least, talked about in previous lessons. I regard this course as practice after you've learned the web trinity and you want to practice it on a webpage. </p>\n\n<p>If you've never touched JavaScript, the code you type will do its thing but you won't know why it is used or how it actually works. Directing students to job sites like Upwork or Freelancer with only the knowledge gathered during this course is a great mistake unless you have decided to do some background reading about HTML, CSS and JS on MDN, W3Schools or another reference site, and made a couple of websites yourself. The most useful part for me in this course was figuring out how to use Bootstrap framework.</p>",

I have learned so much from doing this course and I would recommend it to anyone who has the desire and determination to learn. The downloadable pdfs are an excellent resource to keep for life and when my wifi was playing up I was able to access my pdfs which I had printed. What's more, is that I got my 2 daughters involved, the youngest being 13 and it has been a wonderful way of spending good quality time with each other whilst learning this art.  This course was really good value for money.",

The downloadable pdfs are an excellent resource to keep for life and when my wifi was playing up I was able to access my pdfs which I had printed. What's more, is that I got my 2 daughters involved, the youngest being 13 and it has been a wonderful way of spending good quality time with each other whilst learning this art.  This course was really good value for money.</p>",

The last section on Big data and Spark was extremely frustrating, as the code lines for setting up the virtual machine using AWS and ubuntu were all giving me errors and the Q&A was not helpful. I was not able to follow along this last part.</p>\n\n<p>I understand that it is impossible to update all lectures, overall, Jose did post some notes when changes happened and methods became outdated, but really, the last section was a headache and not useful.</p>",

Linear, logistic, random forest, naive bayesian...\n- Association Rule\n- Data Clustering: k-means, SVM, \n- Neural Networks\n\nAlmost all content is explained nicely.\nI did miss a lecture for the XGBoost model, or even some pointers to bibliography so I could do the research myself. It was suprising as all other sections do have at least 1 single lecture regarding the theory or concepts behind the topic covered.\n\nSome lectures seem to drag unnecessarily. While I think it's great lecturers take their time to explain key areas and concepts, more than a few times the lecture would get stuck for 5 mins + on some area that was explained at the beginning of the course, not adding anything new.\n\nOverall, I give it 4.5/5.\nThe course is very good. The negative points stand out simply because everything else is so polished. Totally recommended if you have no knowledge of ML or if, just like me, you already have some knowledge of certain areas and wish to expand your skillset AND/OR you already have knowledge of ML in either Python or R and wish to learn the other.\n\nAbout the latter point, my take from the course is that certain parts of ML are much more convenient to implement in R, even if (to my opinion) R is not as straightforward as Python.\n\nAs a final note:\nI'd personally recommend you already have at least some programming experience before taking the course. As I mentioned at the beginning, some parts of the course are slightly out of date. Even if they are up to date, some things may not be as straightforward as shown in the lectures. You may need to correct the code yourself, which will require you to have basic notions of object-oriented programming. You can always check the Q&A for people with the same problem as you (everyone has them at some point), or ask the question yourself if you can't find the answer or would like some more clarifications.\n\nFarewell and, as you will hear time and time again throughout this course should you decide to enroll in it, happy machine learning.",
